## Singleton Pattern

The purpose of the Singleton design pattern is to ensure that a class only has one specific instance, and to provide a global point of access to that instance. This is useful when you do not want your class to be instantiated manually, and you need multiple classes to be able to access the same instance of your Singleton.
