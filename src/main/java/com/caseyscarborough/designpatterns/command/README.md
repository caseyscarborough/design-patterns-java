## Command Pattern

The Command Pattern is used primarily to encapsulate requests as an object, letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log them, or add support for undoing operations. This is particularly useful when you'd like to keep track of actions a user has performed, and possibly undo them if the user would like to. CTRL+Z anybody? :)
